# Git Workflow Rules

// turbo-all

1. **Commits**: You may run `git add` and `git commit` automatically after making code changes.

2. **Push**: ALWAYS ask for user permission before running `git push`. Never auto-push without explicit approval.

3. **Batch changes**: Wait for user to confirm they're ready to push, as they may have additional changes to make first.
